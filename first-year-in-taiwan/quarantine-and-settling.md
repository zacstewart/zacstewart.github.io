Aside from the cramped seats and recycled air, I enjoy flying. I like taking trains even more. If I could go back about 100 years, I'd probably enjoy a transatlantic ocean crossing. I once had a boss who proclaimed that she couldn't stand flying because she always needed to be doing something. I'm the exact opposite: I love the freedom from needing to do anything. In normal life, I struggle to squelch the noise surrounding me and focus. For example, writing this, right now, there are a million other things I could be doing, and I have to use a lot of willpower to make myself concentrate. During long trips I find a sense of calm that I rarely do elsewhere. There is nothing else to take care of, and I'm free to let my mind wander. Years ago I had a stress-induced fantasy about going to prison. Of course I'm not so naive about the real conditions in prison, but in my fantasy I could spend all day in my cell reading books and have nothing to worry about.

I finally got to live that fantasy for two weeks. Taiwan requires all travelers to complete 14 calendar days of quarantine upon arrival. Since I arrived at 9 a.m., the first day did not count, so I quarantined for a total of 15 days. You can stay at either an approved quarantine hotel or a goverment-operated quarantine facility. The hotels are booked weeks and even months in advance, and can be fairly expensive. A few weeks before I arrived, I booked a room in Songshan district facing the Keelung River. It was small, but had a balcony, got lots of sunlight, and the bed was super comfortable. Meals showed up three times per day, and usually a snack or some fruit in the afternoon. In addition, I ordered a lot of snacks and some toiletries via Foodpanda. When the staff brought me a meal or something that I ordered, they would leave it on the table outside my door and ring a doorbell. Between checkin and checkout I never saw anyone face-to-face. I had to take my temperature several times per day and report it to the hotel staff via LINE. Someone from the government called a few times to check on me too.

Before departing I tried to think of how to do quarantine well. It was easy to think of ways it could go badly: clausterpobia, anxiety, loneliness, restlessnes, or RSI from bad posture. The most obvious way to pass the time struck me as one of the riskiest: binging on Netflix. It might help me get through a day or two, but after my entertainment receptors got burnt out, I would probably spend most of my time mindlessly browsing the internet trying to find another dopamine hit. I could already feel my body aching with RSI from two weeks of unlimited deskless computer usage. In fact, I only had a big iMac with me, not a laptop, so I decided I wouldn't even unpack it. Although I had a few things to do, I wanted to avoid the trap of trying to force productivity out of this time. I tried to keep a stable sleep schedule, exercise and shower every day, eat lots of fruit and stay healthy. I had Mandarin classes over Zoom, studied a lot, and practiced writing Chinese characters. I finished a book I'd been neglecting for a while. I spent a ton of time on my balcony staring idly at the river, watching people walk or ride bikes along the riverside trail, boats come and go, wedding photo shoots, and groups of schoolkids with their teachers.

One of the things I watched was the construction of a building going on down the street. What I found interesting was that every time a truck left the site, there was a guy hosing it down. He washed all the mud off of the sides, the undercarriage, and the wheels. After the truck rolled on, he sprayed off the the road. In Georgia, you don't see this kind of tidyness. The gate to a construction site is usually a mess, and there will be tracks of red clay up and down the street outside of it. It has never occurred to me that this mess was optional, much less anyone's responsibility. A muddy sidewalk was just one of the minor, annoying facts of life like a rainy day. Of course it's optional: you only have to employ one low-skilled worker whose job it is to prevent it. What's pecuilar is that this isn't a cost-savings so much as a cost transfer from the contractor building the building to the public that has to put up with the mess. I imagine there's an economist who would find it interesting to estimate all the ruined shoes, floormats, and lost time compared to the contractor's savings. I wonder what they'd find. At least qualatatively, Taipei already has the answer.

At first quarantine was fun. I was excited to finally be here, the food was good, and it wasn't much worse than the previous six months of COVID life in the U.S. After the thrill of being in a new place wore off, it became boring. After bordom, I settled into the comfort of routine. Eventually, though, it started to drag. Time started to dialate until I lost track of it. Sometimes it took all day for 10 a.m. to arrive, other times I was surprised to find that the sun was setting hours earlier than it should. Meals arrived, attempting to punctuate one long run-on sentence. The Keelung River swelled and receded in its banks with the tide. The days started to blur together. It was easy to have absurd thoughts, like what if my former life was just an implanted memory, and in reality I've been in this room the whole time, and they just reset me every two weeks? Even today, the memory is a blur, and trying to graft a narrative structure onto it is mostly useless.

When my time was up, Lian Chun and his girlfriend came to pick me up. I had to (once again) move everything out of the hotel by myself in one trip. I waited on the sidewalk for about an hour for them to arrive. I spent the next few days with him in Taipei and Taichung as a guest. Having been almost a month without unpacking and settling somewhere, I started feeling unmoored. I discovered that traveling for a month feels very different from having no home base for a month. When we got back to Taipei I began apartment hunting. My friend David went with me to look at couple of places. After seeing a few apartments, I ended up choosing the first one that I had viewed: a little rooftop add-on studio in Da'an district close to National Taiwan University. It had the best natural light of any apartment that I had seen, and as an addition to multi-story family home, it felt more homey than a big building. I signed a lease on December 2 and moved in the next day.

I spent the rest of the month buying necessities for my apartment and getting to know my neighborhood. I went to Beitou district a couple times to soak in the hot springs, visit the famous library there, and get a library card. I didn't really have a plan, or know what I was going to do next, but I knew I wanted to spend some time enjoying myself and exploring, so I just did that. I still had Mandarin lessons with my teacher online twice a week, but most days I would wake up and walk for several kilometers with no destination. Just walk, see, and learn how daily life works. I also learned that it rains a lot in Taipei during the winter. Basically every day for the entire month of December it rained. I was amazed that this place doesn't flood more often, but after having seen some of the infrastructure that deals with the massive rainfall, it makes more sense.

By the end of December I was feeling restless and idle. I spent a few days with nothing particular to do. Christmas passed and I did nothing in particular to celerbate it. I was cold and tired of the rain. I started to feel like I was waiting, but I had nothing to be waiting on. I spent so much of 2020 waiting on things outside of my control that it was difficult to get out of that mindset. I had nothing keeping me in place, I had no work, no schedule, and plenty of money. Why did it feel like I wasn't doing what I wanted? It turns out it's trickier than expected to have fun, even when there's nothing holding me back. I knew one thing I wanted to do was ride my bike. I had been internally debating whether to wait for spring or to just get the rainy, cold northern part of the trip over with and enjoy the warmer south. In a snap decision, I decided I wasn't going to let 2020 get away without spending at least one day doing something that I wanted. I bought a cycling jacket and some panniers and planned a route to Yilan.
