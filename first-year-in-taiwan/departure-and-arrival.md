The day before I left, my siblings, a few of their significant others, and a niece came to see me off. We ordered a big takeout order and went to a nearby park to eat together. There are so many of us that getting everyone together is notoriously difficult. Even for holidays and birthdays, there will often be someone absent. After eating we went back to my empty apartment. I opened all the windows and turned on the ventilation, probably in vain, but trying to be as responsible as possible during the pandemic. We sat in a circle on the floor and talked for a while. It's unbelievable to see all of us together as adults. The youngest is 14 years younger than me, and it has always felt like I'd have a baby sister forever. More amazing still is to see us not only getting along, but enjoying each others' company. Eight kids growing up in one house, most of us sharing bedrooms, was chaotic to say the least. On my last day in the States I realized, more than ever, that these are the most important people in my life. Each one of them is interesting, leads a weird and exciting life, and I get to follow their seven intertwined stories unfolding in real time. I could chase all the cool strangers in the world and it still wouldn't rival that.

I had already donated, given to friends, or sold off almost everything I owned. Going to Taiwan with me were a bike, a big computer, a ukulele, a suitcase, and a backpack. Noah, my third brother, helped me carry my mattress out to the dumpster. Hannah, my oldest sister, wanted my duvet set. Whatever other knick-knacks were lying around were free for the taking, or going to the dumpster. Hannah's husband Catriel gave me a crash course on DSLR photography. Finally, my niece Camille (not to be confused with my little sister Camille) started getting grumpy, and I had to wake up early to catch my flight, so we said our goodbyes and everyone left.

The apartment where I spent the last three years was now truly empty. My cats would be staying behind for a few months because of some bloodwork and quarantine complications. They were already at a pet hotel. My luggage was waiting next to the door. I had an air mattress and a sheet to spend my last night. I woke up around 5 a.m. and threw them away. As I did so, I suddenly began to fret about how wasteful it was for me to chuck a perfectly good air mattress. I had to solve so many problems to make this move. I had to apply for my residency and keep after immigration officials until I received it. I had to arrange my finances. I had to get my cats vaccinations up to date, get their blood work done, arrange a hotel for them to stay behind for six months, and find a pet shipping agency to fly them over. Why now, at 5 a.m., while dragging a cheap air mattress to the dumpster, was I so torn up? I tried not to think anymore. I had worked on this plan for months, and today I just had to follow my own instructions. I called an Uber and left for the airport.

My flights and connection were a mess. I'll probably never fly with a bike again, or at least not a bike, a computer, and luggage. The previous two times I went to Taiwan I had connections in Tokyo or Seoul. During the pandemic, I thought flying through a third country was probably a bad idea. Who knows what kind of border restrictions or quarantine procedures could arise at the last minute? At first I tried to book a single ticket with a connection in LA, but that flight got canceled. Finally I booked two separate tickets: one with Delta going to JFK and another with EVA Air from JFK to Taipei. I chose EVA because they are a Taiwanese airline. Since the borders were closed to most foreign visitors without residency I was a little worried that an American airline might not be as clear on the rules and refuse to let me board. The downside was that by having two separate tickets, I couldn't check my luggage in Atlanta and pick it up in Taipei.

At JFK I had to leave the terminal, claim my baggage and bring it all to the counter to be rechecked. I nearly exhausted myself lugging all of it across the airport without help, and then discovered that the EVA counter didn't even open until an hour before departure. There was nowhere to check my stuff, and I definitely wasn't going to drag all of it back to where restaurants were, so I sat there on an empty stomach and waited for a whole afternoon. When the counter finally opened, they examined my resident ID card, printed me a boarding pass, and checked my bags. I had brought with me a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test but no one asked to see it. It was not required for residents to have one at the time I was leaving, but I thought it would be a good idea to have one anyway in case rules changed at the last minute. Free of my burdens at last, I made my way to the terminal and got something to eat from a kiosk before my flight departed. The convenience store in my terminal sold little bottles of Prosecco, so I got myself one to celebrate my long-awaited move.

Upon arriving in Taipei I went through border control quickly. Because the border was still closed to non-residents, in the back of my mind I was still a tiny bit afraid they'd refuse me entry. However, I was thrilled when they handed my ID card and passport back and waved me through. Instead of the usual "90 day visa exempt" stamp it said "admitted." Next I had to register with the national quarantine system. I had previously filled out the online form for this, but I had used an American VoIP number, so I had to redo it with a local SIM card. Since many arrivals don't already have one, they have brought telecom vendors right into the terminal next to the quarantine checkpoint, so I was able to buy a SIM card and register for quarantine. The reason you need a local number is because they use your phone's cell tower connection to track your location during quarantine. They told me to keep my phone turned on for the entire two weeks, because if I didn't, a police officer would be sent to check on me. They also have a caseworker contact you every few days while you're in quarantine. After that, I went to claim my luggage and pass through customs. After customs I was actually surprised that I was a free man. Before arriving I had this mental image of walking down a corridor shrouded in plastic, under the watchful eyes of CDC officials in hazmat suits. Instead, unsupervised, I made my way to the exit, stopped to withdraw some cash at an ATM, and once outside lined up to take a quarantine taxi into the city. I had to fill out some forms for them and while I was handling that, someone sprayed all my luggage with alcohol.

The taxi to my quarantine hotel in Songshan district took about an hour because of heavy traffic. I messaged the staff to let them know I was about to arrive. I initially expected that I could leave the bulk of my luggage in storage at the lobby, but they instructed me to take everything with me, by myself, in one trip, up to my room. I had been mostly awake for over 24 hours by this point, wearing a KN95 mask the whole time. I was jet lagged and close to exhaustion, but I crammed everything into the elevator with me. On my floor at the end of the hall I could see the door to my room had been left open for me. I dragged everything down the hall and into my room. On a little table outside of my door there was breakfast waiting for meâ€“corn danbing, chicken nuggets, and brown rice milk. Thus began my 15-day quarantine and one of the more unique experiences of my life.
