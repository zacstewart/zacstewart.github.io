On December 30 I packed my bike touring gear, put bags on my bike and set off to ride a circuit around the country. In Mandarin they call this route the [huándǎo][huandao]. Riding about 100 km per day, you could complete the trip in nine days. I like to take it easy though. I like to go on diversions, stay a while in different places along the way, and make up my route as I go rather than following a set itinerary. During 2017 I completed a trip around the island, but I passed through a few places too quickly, so I wanted to go slowly this time and explore more deeply. I didn't have to be back in Taipei until the Spring semester at National Taipei Normal University started. I was still doing one-on-one Mandarin lessons twice a week with my teacher by joining a Zoom call on my phone, so I tried to line it up so that on those days I wasn't on the bike and had a quiet place to sit. The rest of the time, I would work on homework, write in my journal, walk, or kill time however I saw fit. I spent about two or three days, sometimes more, almost everywhere I went.

## Yilan

I rode through the south of Taipei, into New Taipei City and onto Provincial Highway 9, which crosses the mountains into Yilan County. It was rainy and super cold. I stopped near Pinglin for lunch before pushing onward to Yilan. I can't say I recommend this route. There are a few scenic spots, but nothing amazing for most of the ride. Unfortunately, this route is a very popular place for people to race cars. I was buzzed several times by someone whipping their BWM around the curves. There were also a lot of concrete trucks, and they didn't seem too worried about slowing down or giving me space either. After the last climb to the top of the ridge that separates New Taipei City and Yilan County, I was finally rewarded with a nice view. It was still rainy and cloudy, but I could see the entire fan-shaped plain of Yilan stretched out before me. In the distance, off the coast I could see Turtle Rock in the Pacific Ocean.

Yilan is a county in Taiwan. Counties and cities are not overlapping entities as they are in the States. Rather, cities and counties are at the same level in the hierarchy, but cities are more populous. Yilan is not far from Taipei, but it feels quite different. The food is cheaper, there's more space, the pace of life is slower, and there's interesting stuff to do. I was headed for Jiaoxi: a town in Yilan famous for its hot springs. It's a tourism town, so it's not exactly an authentic countryside experience, but it is a very nice place to unplug for a while. I was chilled to the bone and couldn't wait to soak in the springs. I took in the view from the ridge for a few minutes, until a cat who apparently claims it as his own started howling at me to leave. One more descent and then a few kilometeres along a flat, scooter-clogged road, and I made it to my hostel.

I had an anticlimactic New Year's Eve. In fact, most New Year's Eves in my life have been. I always feel an immense stress to be in the right place, doing the right thing when midnight arrives. Around 10:30 I found a bar and ordered a drink. By 11:00 I was certain this was the wrong place to be. There were about three other customers and it had the vibe of a hotel bar while on a business trip. I checked my phone and decided there was still time to rectify the situation. Before leaving my hostel, I had noticed that there were a few people sitting around the common area. Add some barbecue and a few beers, and surely there would be more fun than here. I went to a barbecue stand and placed an order. The proprietor told me it'd be 40 minutes because he had so many delivery orders. While I waited I went to Family Mart and grabbed a couple of beers. Finally, about ten minutes 'til midnight, with barbecue and beers in hand I tried to run back to my hostel to make it there before the countdown. Near the hostel, I made a desperate dash across the street, cut through a median, slipped in some mud and tripped. When I got inside, to my dismay, it was 12:03 and I had missed it. So much for 2020. At least I still had my barbecue.

I stayed there for a couple days to enjoy the hot springs, went on a short hike to a waterfall, ate food, and generally relaxed and enjoyed myself. The weather never really warmed up though, and despite the hot springs, I couldn't get the chill out of my bones. I decided to keep moving south in search of warmth.

## Hualien

On my last trip, I rode the Suhua Highway from Yilan to Hualien, but this time I decided to take the train. It's one of the prettiest coastal areas I've ever seen, but falling rocks, numerous tunnels, unstable weather, and speeding trucks make it a little dangerous. On a day with good weather, an early start and enough energy, I'd ride it again, but this time I just wanted to get it behind me. Prior to taking my bike on the train, I read about bike cars and reservations and it all sounded pretty complicated. In practice, it seems like as long as you're okay with taking the slower local trains, and not the faster Puyuma or Taroko Express, you can walk into a station and buy a local train ticket with an extra ticket for your bike. The tickets don't have assigned seating and you can board together with your bike and sit or stand wherever you fit.

I spent two days in Hualien City. The last time I was there I only stayed the night and then moved on, so I wanted a whole day to explore and check out the night market. Most of the stuff to do in Hualien County is outdoors and outside of the city. Hualien City itself is pretty small, and doesn't offer a lot, so you can get bored pretty quickly if you're not taking day trips. On my last night there, a group of college kids were playing Uno in the hostel. I'm always eager to see if people can actually understand me when I speak Chinese in a novel situation, so I asked if I could play with them. They said sure, and we played a few games of Uno and then some other card games, which turned into drinking card games, and before I knew it, it was 1 am. I woke up a little later than intended the next morning, but ready to get back on the road.

The next segment is one of my all-time favorite places to ride. Between Hualien and and Taitung, along the east coast, there is a small mountain range called the Hai'an Range. It's a smaller, separate range from the Central Mountain Range that divides the East and West sides of Taiwan. Between these two mountain ranges lies the East Rift Valley. It's a lush, aggricultural area dotted with small towns and a clear view of mountains on either side as you cruise along. It's pretty flat, and during the two times I've ridden through, the weather was stable and mild. I stopped in a small town called Fenglin for lunch. It's a town I rode through last time, and it caught my eye this time just as it did then. It has a little park in the middle of town near the train station, where vendors are usually selling food. By late afternoon I reached the Tropic of Cancer. Last time, I stopped here and stayed the night in the hot springs town of Ruisui and then rode over the Hai'an mountains to the coast in the morning. This time I decided to keep riding south in the Valley for another day before heading to the coast. An hour later I made it to Yuli, where I spent the night.

I love visiting small towns, and I love that traveling by bike gives me a reason to. Taiwan is very small, and if you travel by train or bus to visit the usual places, the travel time is so short that there isn't much of a reason to stay in the in-between places. Furthermore, fast trains usually don't stop somewhere like Fenglin anway, so you would have to intentionally choose to take a local train, otherwise it would just be another station wooshing past. I asked the host at my hostel if there was any local food I should try for dinner. He recommended the aptly named Yuli noodles and gave me a pin on the map. Dinner was so good that I came back on my way out for breakfast.

## Taitung

After breakfast I started climbing the Hai'an mountains. This route was much gentler than I remember riding over these mountains at Ruisui was. At the top there's a tunnel and then a sharp descent down to the coast near Chenggong. Chenggong is a little town with no real reason to visit, but in 2017 I liked the vibe and decided to stay the night. That time, I met a Japanese guy who lived there named Kenji. He chased me down on his scooter because he's a cyclist and liked my Surly. We ended up riding together for a few hours the next day. Since I was passing through again this year I sent him a message to see if he wanted to meet up. He has sinced moved to another village nearby, but we got coffee at 7-Eleven and caught up for a while before I got back on the road. I was trying to get to Donghe by the end of the day. A few years ago while I was riding with Kenji we passed through here and had breakfast at the famous Donghe Baozi steamed bun shop. He said that Donghe and the next town the the south, Dulan, are both surf spots. I'd never tried to surf, so I wanted to do that.

Along the way, whenever I stopped, I would message some local surf shops ahead of time to see if they could arrange a surf lesson for me. They kept telling me that they don't offer lessons during winter because the waves are too rough. By the time I got to Donghe I had gotten the same answer several times, but I figured that once I was there it'd be easier to convince someone that I wouldn't drown and to take me anyway. At the hostel I stayed at, there was only one other guest: a French guy that's lived in Taiwan for a long time. He was there to surf, so I asked him what he thought. He said that, in fact, the waves weren't too rough right now, but these shops probably don't have staff on hand for lessons because *usually* the waves are too rough during winter. If I could find someone to take me, it should be no problem. In the morning a group of surfers, half Taiwanese and half foreigners, showed up at my hostel (which is also a cafe) to have breakfast. One of them seemed friendly so I said hey and we started talking. He's American named Tim living in Taiwan and splits his time between Taipei and Donghe. I asked if he'd be willing to take me along if he's going surfing later. He said sure, he'd rent me a board and give me a lesson for the same price as shops in town. We went back to his place, got boards, wetsuits and went to Jinzun harbor.

I like surfing so much that I rented a room from Tim and went with him a couple more times. He's a great guy, and I really enjoyed having a few days of conversation with an insightful person after being lonely on the road. He's lived in Taiwan for several years, but has lived all over. He was originally an architect, but now flips houses. He loves surfing and arranges his life to spend as much time possible doing that. This is one of my favorite things about traveling: interesting people are all over, mostly living low-key lives, and you won't find them by subscribing to their podcast or following them on instagram.

A couple days later Tim had to return to Taipei, but offered to let me keep a board and stay at his place. It's a little far outside of town though, and I wanted to be around people, so I declined and decided to head down to Dulan to stay at a hostel. In retrospect I should have kept riding, because the weather turned bone-chilling cold the next day and I spent the next few days inside the hostel freezing instead of surfing. I didn't bring nearly enough layers on this trip. 2017 wasn't perfect, but the cycling jacket I had with me was a little warmer. This time I only had a waterproof windbreaker and unrelistic optimism for warm weather.

## Southern Tip

Throroughly chilled and growing impatient with waiting for the weather to improve, I decided to keep moving south. After of Taitung City, the population thins out. Despite being further into the tropical zone, it feels chillier than the coast around Donghe. The terrain alternates between river basins, where small towns are nestled, and coastal cliffs skirted by elevated highways. I love the solitude and natural beauty, but I always get a lonely mood riding into this area. It's one of those places with a shrinking population. Many young people have moved to the cities for school and work, so the population skews older. As I was passing through Taitung City I realized that I had lost my spare tire somewhere. It was bungied to my cargo rack, but I must have knocked it off somehow. I rode around to a few bike shops but they were all closed. After a few dead ends I gave up and continued down the coast. During my trip a few years ago I slashed a tire almost immediately, and if not for a bit of luck it would have been a bad time. Soon I'd be passing through an area without the railway as a fallback. I didn't like the prospect of being stranded with an unridable bike in the mountains, but I hoped for the best.

Before setting out from Dulan, I hadn't decided how far I'd ride or where I'd stop for the night. I had the same chill in my bones that I had had on the first day of this trip while headed toward Jaoxi. While passing through here in 2017, a gigantic bridge next to a town called Jinlun caught my attention. This was one of the things that blew my mind the first time I came to Taiwan: the size and ubiquity of bridges and other infrastructure. The kind of bridges I am used to in Georgia are little concrete things with green trusses underneath. Not very impressive to look at. Then again, Georgia doesn't really have a very dramatic landscape. Taiwan's terrain is a tangle of rivers, mountains, cliff faces, earth quakes, and landslides. Jinlun is a small hot springs town with a big aboriginal population. The closer I got, the more I daydreamed about a nice soak in the hot springs to chase away my chill. I got there at around 4 p.m. and decided to stay the night.

The next day was my last one on the East Coast. Last time I stayed along the coast all the way around and visited the southernmost point, Cape Eluanbi. This time I decided to skip that and ride over the southern tip of the Central Mountain Range, through Mudan township, to Hengchun. There are several ways to get over the range, but all of them pass through the same mountain pass at Shouka. This ride offers a lot of diversity of terrain. The remainder of the east coast from Jinlun, before going inland at Daren, gave me the same gloomy chill as the day before. Once I left the coast, it turned into a slow, steady climb, and with the elevation, my mood improved as well. Along the way, there is a small temple that is home to a large family of cats. I stopped to rest for a while and take in the view before finishing the climb. Shouka mountain pass is where Taitung and Pingtung counties meet. In the past there was a police checkpoint, but it has been converted into a cyclist rest stop. I stopped for a little while, but aside from the bathroom, everything was closed.

I had good energy after the climb and a nice slow descent ahead of me through the interior of the peninsula. This area is quite distinct: a large portion of the population are aboriginal. It's much less developed than other parts of Taiwan and there are no trains. It also happens to be the region where Seqalu 1867, a recent historical TV drama, takes place. I've noted many smaller rodes that may be interesting to ride, but it's hard to know what remains a road and what will turn into a trail before it connects to somewhere else. I'd like to come back to stay for a while and explore without worrying about getting to a destination every day. As the descent levels out, the terrain gives way to fields and rice paddies. I rolled into Checheng around 4 or 5 p.m. Certain that I'd make it to Hengchung within an hour or so, I searched for a hostel there and called ahead to reserve a bed. Hengchun is one of my favorite places in Taiwan. It still has a very well preserved old town surrounded by walls with four gates. I rode throught West Gate and to my hostel near the Old Street. Upon arrival I realized a happy accident: without knowing, I had reserved a bed at a diving hostel.
