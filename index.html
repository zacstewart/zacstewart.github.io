  I'm a freelance software engineer specializing in computer vision. I have a
  proven track record of delivering impactful solutions for more than a decade.
</p>

<p>
  I've helped startups to research and develop their core intellectual property
  in computer vision, machine learning and AI since 2016. Some recent projects
  include a real-time markerless motion capture system for professional soccer
  matches, an automated damage detection system for collectable items, and an
  AI-powered video auto-cropping platform. Before freelancing I worked at
  consultancies, startups, and one Big Tech Co. as a software engineer, my last
  full-time role being Lead Software Engineer at Salesforce.

  When I'm not at work I enjoy bicycle touring and SCUBA diving. I am
  practicing photography, learning Mandarin Chinese, and love sour beers.
